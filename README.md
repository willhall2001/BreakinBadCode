## Structure of Repository 
All the raw data can be accessed in the "Final_DataFrames" folder 
- This folder containes each chunk of raw data used throughout the code blocks 

To access this data, the read_csv codes present in each chunk will have to be changed to fit local repositories 

Each of the models can be ran with no issue
- Processing time is low, so "Run All" can be used on each of the "Machine_Learning_Model" files
